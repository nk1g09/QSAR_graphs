Ideas/ fixes to qsar svg 

- change compound display so it doesn't go off the edge of the svg image. 
this could either be extending the image? or calculating the position of the far edges and if this is
 greater than the boundaries of the svg then it can move it to the other side/ shift it in by the 
 difference between the values.
 DONE
 
 - change the webpage to allow selection of the property expected on the y.axis and on the x.axis
 this would have to be selected from a list? which sets a variable with is referenced in the rest of the code.
  DONE - allows selection of any variable which is a header in the file. changes the plot and titles.
 - would need to only allow option to be selected if the values within them are numerical
 
 - allow upload of a file - this could cause issues if the file does not have the same structure as is expected by the code
 or if the structure cannot be determined by the code. It may be possible to read the first like of the code and set variables for each column header by looping the through the variables?
 might not use javascript in that section?
 
 - doesn't appear to load in internet explorer... d3 is 'undefined'
 
 -need to change InChi text to be wrapped and also not move 'offscreen' like with the image overlay.
 InChI text is now wrapped using div and html - but it does not position relative to the edge of the svg image. 
 If the point is to the right of the svg it will just extend further to the right (still displaying)
